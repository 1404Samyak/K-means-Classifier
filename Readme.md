This is a classification test case solved using Kmeans classifier along with hyperparamter tuning to best parameters such as value of k and the algorithm to be used like KD Tree,Ball Tree,brute or auto
For hyperparameter tuning StratifiedKFold is used as cv technique and Grid search cv is used for finding best possible parameters
In this use case Kmeans classifier gives higher accuracy than the logistic regression model with multiclass='ovr'
